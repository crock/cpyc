						CPYC hosts several kids at every home game of the San Diego Chargers. We have partnered with the San Diego Police Department Star/PAL organization in providing this program.
						<br>
						<br>
						Kids are selected from a large group of low income families that live within San Diego County. San Diego Police Officers and Star/PAL staff, transport the kids and set up a pre-game barbecue before they enter the stadium for a Chargers home game. 
						<br>
						<br>
						For the second year in a row, Chargers Punter Mike Scifres has generously donated the tickets for the kids to attend the games throughout the season. We thank Mike Scifres for his tremendous contribution to the kids in the San Diego community.

						Major League Baseball’s Oakland A’s and California Police Youth Charities have partnered to reach out to kids in Northern California in a very unique way. 
						<br>
						<br>
						CPYC is now the sponsor of the Home Run Readers program which is a curriculum based reading program that is currently implemented in 150 elementary schools facilitated by individual teachers within 15 of California’s counties.
						<br>
						<br>
						Children are rewarded for their outstanding reading accomplishments with tickets to A’s games, A’s/CPYC bookmarks and A’s caps as well as other Oakland A’s items. Many of the schools are treated to personal appearances by A’s players, coaches and front office staff as well as uniformed police officers who read to the kids in the classroom. Even the owner of the Oakland A’s has volunteered to read to kids.

						California Police Youth Charities is proud to announce that our Game Day for Kids Program with the Sacramento Kings NBA team will be available for the upcoming season. 
						<br>
						<br>
						The program consists of targeting children who would benefit the most from experiencing a day of fun and friendship while attending professional basketball games with staff of CPYC as well as members of the law enforcement community and our celebrity advisory panel. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Children will be given tickets to the game and may get to experience opportunities that range from high fiving the players as they enter the court to actually playing basketball on an NBA court prior to the game. We want to thank the Sacramento Kings for their contributions to this program and we look forward to many years of working together. 
						<br>
						<br>
						For more information regarding taking groups of deserving kids to an NBA game in Sacramento, please contact the CPYC main office at 916-787-4201extension 12.

					<!-- fourth section (scholarships) -->
					<p>
						The Youth Leadership Scholarship award is presented to high school seniors who will be attending college in the fall.  The essay competition requires students to describe how they have made a positive difference in their communities during their high school years. 
						<br>
						<br>
						The scholarship is between $500 and $1,000 per student. To be eligible, the student must be a biological or adopted child of an active or retired law enforcement officer within the State of California. This scholarship was created in an effort to recognize the sacrifices that law enforcement officers endure daily while protecting the lives and property of California’s citizens.
